# Python Sklearn Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a Python project that utilizes scikit-learn (sklearn) library for various machine learning tasks.

## Overview

The project focuses on implementing machine learning algorithms using the sklearn library to solve classification, regression, and clustering problems. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Contents

- `data`: This folder contains the datasets used for training and testing the machine learning models.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks showcasing the usage of sklearn for different tasks, including data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
- `scripts`: Python scripts that provide utility functions and helper classes for the machine learning process.
- `results`: This folder stores the evaluation metrics, visualizations, and saved models.
